# TikTok Sales Helper

Originally a project submitted for TikTok Techjam 2024, I continued the development of the project and added more features.

Original project [here](https://github.com/joseyjh/sales-helper-hackathon), which was built on top of [WhisperLive](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive), a nearly-live implementation of OpenAI's Whisper.
