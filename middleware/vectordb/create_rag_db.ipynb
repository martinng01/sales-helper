Let\\'s take a look at that next.About the Ad Group LevelYou can set specific ad placements, audiences, target audiences, campaign budgets, schedule, optimization goals, and bids for each ad group at the ad group level.

When you create an ad campaign, you will need to set up the advertising objective, campaign name, and budget. Before getting startedBefore you set up an ad campaign, consider what you want people to do when they see your ads. Objectives fall into three categories: awareness, consideration, and conversion. For example, if your goal is to attract more visitors to your website, you can choose the Traffic objective in the Consideration category. If you\\'re unsure about what objective is right for your campaign, learn How to choose the right objective.

Note: Campaign names support 512 characters.Declare a Special ad category, if relevant.Toggle on/off Create split test and Campaign budget optimization options.Set a campaign budget.

       " Document(page_content='This article briefly introduces the definition of budget and how it works.Budget is the total amount of money you are willing spend for running ads, and can be a great tool for cost control. While bidding is used for controlling the cost per result as the ad level, budgeting is used to control the overall costs for campaigns and ad groups.You can set budgets for both campaigns and ad groups (one campaign can consists of several ad groups). There are 2 types of budgets, lifetime budgets and daily budgets.Note: Once you publish your campaign, you cannot change the budget type at the campaign or ad group level. As such, you will be unable to switch from a daily budget to a lifetime budget and vice versa.Lifetime BudgetThe lifetime budget is the maximum amount you are willing to spend on a campaign or ad group during the entire defined period you run an ad.Please note that when using lifetime budget on the ad group level, the delivery system will try to distribute the spending of your budget to run throughout the entire provided time range, but it is not guaranteed to allocate the budget exactly evenly on day-to-day. If you would like to set a daily spending cap, please use the daily budget instead.Daily BudgetThe daily budget is the maximum you are willing to spend on a campaign or ad group per day. Lifetime and daily budgets are set as upper limits and the amount actually spent during the delivery period can be less than the budget amount you specified. However, the cost of your campaign or ad group will never exceed the budget you set. Please keep in mind that if you select \"Daily Budget\" for a campaign, you must select \"Daily Budget\" at the ad group level. If you select \"Lifetime Budget\" for a campaign, you can select either \"Daily Budget\" or \"Lifetime Budget\" at the ad group level.Dynamic Daily Budget: This feature is not widely available yet. Please reach out to your account representative for more information.Dynamic daily budget is the average daily budget you are willing to spend for a week. When you set the daily amount you would like to spend, our system will spend up to 25% more on days where there are better opportunities and less on days where there are not. The daily spend charges will average out to the amount you set over the course of the week (Sunday to Saturday). The weekly overall spend will not surpass more than 7 times the daily budget. (For additional information, refer to About Dynamic Daily Budget.Minimum BudgetA minimum budget is required when setting both lifetime budgets and daily budgets in order to ensure the continuous delivery of your ad.\\u200bCampaign level minimum budget: For campaigns, both daily budgets and total budgets must exceed 50 USD.\\u200bAd group level minimum budget: For ad groups, daily budgets must exceed 20 USD. Lifetime budgets will be calculated as the minimum daily budget (20 USD) × scheduled days.For example: If delivery is scheduled for 31 days, the minimum budget for the ad group would be 20 USD × 31 days = 620 USD.

       " Document(page_content=\"Before getting started: Reach & Frequency is currently only available to qualified customers. Please contact your sales representative for more information. Reach & Frequency (R&F) is a campaign buying type on TikTok Ads Manager that lets you control the audiences you reach and the number of times they are exposed to your ad messaging before delivery. Compared to Auction ads where ad delivery is determined by factors such as bid or bid strategy, with R&F you'll schedule campaigns with predictable reach and controlled frequency at a set cost.How Reach & Frequency worksWhen you create a Reach & Frequency campaign, it'll utilize three main components at the Ad Group level:\\u200bTargeting: The audience size that you may reach.\\u200bSchedule: When your ads will be delivered.\\u200bReservation and purchase method: Unique to R&F.
